# Technical documents

Since 2019, Cloud-Barista Community has been researching and developing multi-cloud common platform technology, and has consistently shared related technical documents. 

From now on, we plan to expand to cloud migration technology based on multi-cloud common platform technology. Therefore, we would like to share documents related to cloud migration technology that have been inherited and expanded from the existing documents. See [cloud-migrator](https://github.com/cloud-barista/docs/tree/master/technical_docs/cloud-migrator "docs/technical_docs/cloud-migrator") directory.

Note - We will freeze the existing technical documents as is. See [cloud-barista](https://github.com/cloud-barista/docs/tree/master/technical_docs/cloud-barista "docs/technical_docs/cloud-barista") directory
